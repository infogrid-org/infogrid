Limitations:
 * If a MeshObject has more than one problem and at least one of them is being
   fixed, all others are being fixed, too, as InfoGrid cannot write partially
   invalid MeshObjects to disk
 * Mandatory properties that nevertheless currently have null values can only
   be set to static default values, not the dynamic ones (using
   <defaultvalue code="java"> in the model)
